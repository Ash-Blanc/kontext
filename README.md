### Audio Analysis Note

This version uses Google Generative AI API which doesn't support direct audio analysis. Audio features will provide general guidance about audio analysis limitations and suggest alternative approaches.

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

The app includes several optimizations to reduce response times:

### üöÄ Speed Mode
Press `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + S` to toggle **Speed Mode**:
- **Enabled**: Automatically uses Gemini 1.5 Flash (fastest model) with optimized settings
- **Disabled**: Uses your selected model with standard settings

### üì∏ Image Optimization
- Screenshots are automatically compressed before sending to the API
- Reduces image size by ~60-80% while maintaining quality
- Uses JPEG compression at 75% quality for optimal speed/quality balance

### üéØ Smart Token Limits
- **Flash models**: 2048 tokens (fastest)
- **Gemini 1.5 models**: 3072 tokens (balanced)
- **Other models**: 4096 tokens (detailed)

### üí° Quick Tips for Better Performance
1. **Use Speed Mode** (`Cmd+Shift+S`) for faster responses
2. **Choose the right model**:
   - Flash models: Fast, good for simple questions
   - Gemini 1.5 Pro: Balanced speed and quality
   - Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental: Latest features with good speed
   - Gemini 1.0 Pro: Stable but slower
3. **Take smaller screenshots** when possible
4. **Use concise prompts** for faster processing
